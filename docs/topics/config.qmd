## Params and nodes configs

### param_publish

Default: False.

If True, the root node will publish the params to the shared cache. The child
node can access these params through the cache.

### param_subscribe

Default: True.

If True, the non-root node will look for the param values in the shared cache
in case the param is not explicitly set by user and doesn't have default value.
If False, the node will not look for param in shared cache.

### allow_extra

Default: False.

If True, the function will allow extra params that are not defined in the
function definition without raising an error. If False, the function will raise
error when the extra params are passed during its initialization.
