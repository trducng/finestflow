`theflow` aims for:

_**Composable function**_: functions can be combined into more complex composite
functions. Functions and params in composite functions can easily be switched
and swapped.

_**Pipeline tracability**_: input and output to a function can be logged and
investigated.

_**Fast execution**_: utilize cache whenever possible.

_**Simple to run local**_: most of the pipeline building happen at local.
Developers have as much freedom to design their desired pipelines. They are
also equipped with tools and functionalities to help them arrive at the final
pipeline.

_**Simple to deploy to workflow orchestrator**_: once a production-ready
pipeline has been made, developers can quickly deploy this pipeline to a matured
production-grade pipeline execution system.
